## SuiteScript 2.0 Script Types and Entry Points

While utilizing SuiteScript, you'll eventually have to decide between a handfull of **Script Types**.
These let you determine when and how are your events gonna trigger, whether they trigger in the
clients browser or in the server or even what is the script trying to accomplish in the first place.

- **Client Scripts** are designed for scripts that should run in the browser.

- **Scheduled Scripts** are for server-side scripts that should run at a specific time or on a recurring schedule.

- **RESTlet Scripts** are for server-side scripts that should execute when called over HTTP by an application external to NetSuite.
